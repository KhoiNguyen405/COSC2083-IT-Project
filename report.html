    <p>Team Profile: Team name: Leap Forward. Name: Mai K Dang Khoa. Student number: s4058813. Background: . Hobbies: I like playing basketball as a hobby since it offers a multitude of physical, mental, and social benefits. I also like basketball because it requires quick thinking, adaptability to changing situations, and strategic planning. Learning to anticipate opponents' moves and devising effective strategies can be intellectually stimulating. IT Interests: I am interested in Artificial Intelligence. My interest in AI sparked from its incredible potential to transform various aspects of our lives. I'm fascinated by how AI algorithms can process expansive amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions with extraordinary accuracy. It's like teaching machines to think and learn, which opens up unlimited possibilities. IT Experience: I have an intermediate level understanding of  Microsoft Office apps, basic understanding in Python coding and I'm an amateur modeler.</p>

    <p>Group Processes:</p> 
    <p>Communication: We use Messenger to communicate with each other while discussing things related to assignments due to how fast, convenient and versatile it is. So far, everyone has been cooperative.</p> 
    <p>Group reflection: Seemingly the website building has gone pretty well. The goal of building a drag-and-drop website has been very clear, which is to educate people about IT. The website itself is easy to use. I do not think there is anything to improve in my opinion. There are at least two things that I find surprising about this project as a whole. One is that everyone has been very cooperative, much more cooperative compared to projects from my other courses.  Two is how much of a great leader one can be.</p>
