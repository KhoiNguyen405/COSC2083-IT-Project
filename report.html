          <p>Background: I am a first year student at RMIT University at Saigon campus.</p>
          <p>Hobbies: I like playing basketball as a hobby since it offers a multitude of physical, mental, and social
            benefits. I also like basketball because it requires quick thinking, adaptability to changing situations,
            and strategic planning. Learning to anticipate opponents' moves and devising effective strategies can be
            intellectually stimulating.</p>
          <p>IT Interests: I am interested in Artificial Intelligence. My interest in AI sparked from its incredible
            potential to transform various aspects of our lives. I'm fascinated by how AI algorithms can process
            expansive amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions with extraordinary
            accuracy. It's like teaching machines to think and learn, which opens up unlimited possibilities.</p>
          <p>IT Experience: I have an intermediate level understanding of Microsoft Office apps, basic understanding in
            Python coding and I'm an amateur modeler.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Roles</h2>
        <p>The roles for each team member during the approximate 4 weeks of project work were planned to be as follows:
          Khoi as the Lead developer, Khang as the User interface designer and developer, and Khoa as the Web developer
          and Tester.</p>
        <p>As the person with the most web development experience, Khoi would take on the role as Lead developer for the
          project to manage and assign appropriate responsibilities for the other team members. Specifically, Khoi
          needed to take the initiative to set deadlines and project goals with specific tasks for each team member. As
          for his own programming tasks, Khoi would be responsible for coding the majority of the interactive features
          on the project demo webpage.</p>
        <p>Khang initially took the role of a User Interface (UI) designer due to his creativity and understanding of
          engaging user interface from playing video games. He designed the interface for the project webpages,
          including for the interactive activity in the demo webpage. Afterwards, Khang also would take over the role of
          a UI developer and implemented his designs for the project website and the report webpage.</p>
        <p>Khoa, on the other hand, volunteered to develop the front-end for the project website, as he wanted to
          improve his skills in web development, specifically in HTML programming. The web pages that he worked on
          include the demo page and the report page. In addition to his web development tasks, Khoa would also take the
          role of a tester for the interactive activities in the demo webpage. His responsibilities would then include
          ensuring the demo works correctly by identifying bugs and designing test cases.</p>

        <p>To build this website we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, each with different purposes.
          HTML defines the structure of draggable elements, CSS can style the elements and provides the layout.
          JavaScript
          is for implementing drag-and-drop functionality by handling events. Khoi had a bit of prior experience but
          most
          of his experience come from this project.</p>

      <div class="subsection" id="testing">
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Testing</h2>
        <p>The website's drag-and-drop function is tested by dragging chunks of code around to see if it works. All
          the functions of the website have been working smoothly so far. We will know when we have succeed when you get
          the wrong answer, the frame goes red and the score is lost and vice versa, when you get the right answer, the
          frame
          goes green and the score is counted towards the total score. If we were to test users, we would need at least
          3-5 people to test out the website, and to get them to test out the page we would need to send testers with
          some
          Visual Studio code experience the coding for the website.</p>

        <p>There were two difficulties we ran into. First was coding in Javascript due to how hard it was. Second was

          So
          far, everyone has been cooperative and fast in responding although there were a few late responses. Khoi is in
          charge of making the website to showcase in our presentation while Khang works on coding the CSS styling for

          report website. Meanwhile Khoa works on the report page in HTML and write his part in the report. All in all

          more easily store and retrieve data about activities and study materials would be greatly beneficial for the
          final product. Therefore, this position will require a good understanding of database design to optimize the
          data storage and retrieval process for the website. The back-end developer will also need proficiency in
          JavaScript and an object-oriented programming language, such as Java or C#, to integrate the database
          functionalities with the UI. For this goal, they will collaborate closely with the front-end developer.

          a deep understanding of the product’s specifications and needs and to identify and resolve any issues that may
          come up during the development cycle. The tester will apply their knowledge on software testing and web
          development to create detailed test cases and produce testing artifacts, such as test plans and test reports.
          Knowledge of automated testing to implement reliable, accurate and repeatable testing will be a potential

        <p>The website building has gone well. The goal of building a drag-and-drop website has been noticeably clear,
          which is to educate people about IT. The website itself is easy to use. I do not think there is anything to
          improve in my opinion.
          There are at least two surprising things about this project. One is that everyone has been very cooperative,
          much more cooperative compared to projects from my other courses.
          Two is how much of a great leader Khoi can be, as he split the project into an appropriate number of tasks for
          each of us to work on.
          Moreover, he gives me a valid opinion on how to work on an HTML report.
          I have learned something remarkably interesting about groups.
          They all have various other projects with unique approach methods which to me is fascinating. </p>
