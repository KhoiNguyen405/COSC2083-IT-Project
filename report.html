    <strong>Report:</strong> 
    <p>Team Profile:</p>
    <p>-Team name: Leap Forward.</p>
    <p>-Name: Mai K Dang Khoa.</p>
    <p>-Student number: s4058813.</p> 
    <p>-Background: I am a first year student at RMIT University at Saigon campus.</p> 
    <p>-Hobbies: I like playing basketball as a hobby since it offers a multitude of physical, mental, and social benefits. I also like basketball because it requires quick thinking, adaptability to changing situations, and strategic planning. Learning to anticipate opponents' moves and devising effective strategies can be intellectually stimulating.</p>
    <p>-IT Interests: I am interested in Artificial Intelligence. My interest in AI sparked from its incredible potential to transform various aspects of our lives. I'm fascinated by how AI algorithms can process expansive amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions with extraordinary accuracy. It's like teaching machines to think and learn, which opens up unlimited possibilities.</p>
    <p>-IT Experience: I have an intermediate level understanding of  Microsoft Office apps, basic understanding in Python coding and I'm an amateur modeler.</p>
    <p>Tools and Technologies: To build this website we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, each with different purposes. HTML defines the structure of draggable elements, CSS can style the elements and provides the layout. JavaScript is for implementing drag-and-drop functionality by handling events. Khoi had a bit of prior experience but most of his experience come from this project.</p> 
    <p>Testing: The website's drag-and-drop function is tested by dragging chunks of code around to see if it works. The dragging function has been working so far but the dropping function seems to not work currently. There are also two buttons that don't work currently, "Check answers" and "Clear". However, the missing functions will be added in the future.</p> 
    <p>Group Processes and Communication: We use Messenger to communicate with each other while discussing things related to assignments due to how fast, convenient and versatile it is, therefore, no meetings were required. So far, everyone has been cooperative and fast in responding although there were a few late responses. Khoi is in charge of making the website to showcase in our presentation while Khang works on coding the CSS styling for the report website. Meanwhile I work on the report page in HTML and write my part in the report. All in all this project has been smoooth and the work was suitably split.</p> 
    <p>Group reflection: Seemingly the website building has gone pretty well so far. The goal of building a drag-and-drop website has been very clear, which is to educate people about IT. The website itself is easy to use. I do not think there is anything to improve in my opinion. There are at least two things that I find surprising about this project as a whole. One is that everyone has been very cooperative, much more cooperative compared to projects from my other courses.  Two is how much of a great leader Khoi can be, due to the fact that he split the project into approprite amount of tasks for each of us to work on. Moreover, he gives me a valid opinion on how to work on an HTML report. I've learned something very interesting about groups. They all have various other projects with unique approach methods which to me is fascinating.</p>
