          <p>I am a first year student at RMIT University at Saigon campus.
            I like playing basketball as a hobby since it offers a multitude of physical, mental, and social
            benefits. I also like basketball because it requires quick thinking, adaptability to changing situations,
            and strategic planning. Learning to anticipate opponents' moves and devising effective strategies can be
            intellectually stimulating.</p>
          <p>I am interested in Artificial Intelligence. My interest in AI sparked from its incredible
            potential to transform various aspects of our lives. I'm fascinated by how AI algorithms can process
            expansive amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions with extraordinary
            accuracy. It's like teaching machines to think and learn, which opens up unlimited possibilities.
            I have an intermediate level understanding of Microsoft Office apps, basic understanding in
            Python coding and I'm an amateur modeler.</p>

          commit code to the repository as much as the rest of the team. However, he still contributed a lot, both with
          writing the report and with implementing the deliverable, by sharing his design notes and performing pair

      <div class="subsection" id="overview">
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>From the start, our team has already set our target on making a game that can entertain or help younger
          audiences to learn something new. We also thought of using VR to better enhance the experience for the user as
          well as helping them to engage in the experience even more. We also tried to put different genres into it to
          help make the game more interesting like horror.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, we took some time to get ideas from each member to get different aspect of what we are going to
          do, and we got back some very interesting ideas from each person in the team, and we accept on one idea which
          is making the a drag and drop coding style for simple coding to help more people getting familiar with it
          since the new era of AI is coming and it will help people not getting confuse by what the AI is doing. There
          is a similarity since our team took inspiration from the website from scratch.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="subsection" id="aims">
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Aims</h2>
        <p>As said from above, we agreed to make a website where any audience can participate in learning various topics
          which is mainly focus on computer science and IT things by using a very simple mechanic which is drag and drop
          style. That is our main aim for this project.</p>
        <p>One of our goals is that we will include the horror genre into the game as we have mentioned, but after some
          feedback we got, we decided to cancel it since it may scare away younger audiences which then conflicts with
          our main aim for this project. This doesn’t make us setback much since it helps us focus more on the main
          goal, which we will be promoting the education part even further.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="subsection" id="plans-progress">
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Plans and Progress</h2>
        <p>Our team set out from the beginning to develop a product that was both fun and educational. The initial idea,
          stemming from the project idea proposed in assignment 2, was to create a puzzle game centered around AI, with
          the goal of educating players about different topics related to AI through an interactive medium. However, as
          we researched game development and considered the time constraints for this project, we ultimately decided
          against the idea of developing a game. At the same time, we did not want to abandon our goal to create a fun
          and educational product. So, after brainstorming for around a week, we settled on developing a website with
          interactive activities about coding and other IT-related topics.</p>
        <p>Our main inspiration was the website Scratch, specifically the drag-and-drop activity at the core of that
          website. Our product would also maintain a core activity involving dragging chunks of code and dropping them
          into the correct spots, with the purpose of forming a functional piece of code. To add to this idea, as well
          as to differentiate it from Scratch, we would focus our activities on curated IT topics and guide the user to
          solve a variety of problems, akin to a study resource for an IT or computer science course.</p>
        <p>After defining our project idea more clearly, the first step of our plans was to research and learn the
          different technologies required for such a website. These include HTML and CSS for building the website, as
          well as JavaScript for implementing the drag-and-drop interaction. Due to our general lack of experience with
          web development, our team decided to develop the HTML and CSS code for our project from scratch, without using
          any website builder like Wix. This decision ended up costing a significant amount of development time, since
          we were learning as we were building the website. As we neared the deadline for the project, we downscaled our
          objective from creating a full-fledged website to just developing a single webpage serving as a demo for the
          drag-and-drop activity.</p>
        <p>With our new and more achievable objective, our website development progressed much more smoothly. The
          drag-and-drop interface was implemented using JavaScript and integrated directly into the HTML code of the
          website. The coding activity chosen for the demo to showcase our product idea was a simple implementation of a
          FOR loop using the Java programming language. A scoring system was also implemented into the activity, to
          maintain a light-hearted mood, as well as to uphold the entertainment aspect of our original idea. After
          designing different test plans and performing manual testing to ensure correct functionality, we chose to
          apply only minimal CSS styling to our demo webpage in order to focus on writing the report and building the
          website for the report. Overall, we are satisfied with our demo product and consider our objective
          successfully completed.</p>
        <p>However, since we had to downscale the objective to meet the limited time constraints for this assignment,
          there are still many front-end features that we wanted to implement but did not have the capacity to do so.
          One of the initial deliverables that we wanted to make was an onboarding webpage for our website. This page
          would have included an in-depth explanation about the purpose of our product, a guide for the drag-and-drop
          activities, as well as information about each team member. Another aspect of the initial objective was
          building a template for the activity and lesson webpages to facilitate the process of creating new activities
          for the website in the future. Although we did not build a full template that can be easily applied for any
          future additional activity, we managed to optimize the code that handles the demo activity so that it can be
          easily scaled up and moved separately to a template.</p>
        <p>To meet our goal of making our product educational for the user, there are still some features that need to
          be added. One such feature is showing an explanation for incorrect answers from the user, so that they can
          learn from their mistake while engaging with the activities. This can be implemented by determining potential
          mistakes that a user could make in a given activity and displaying an explanation message for these errors
          depending on the user’s actual input. Another beneficial feature is to allow the user to run the code that
          they built through the activity. This way, they can receive extra feedback and potentially troubleshoot their
          mistakes themselves by comparing the code output with the expected output. Running dynamically created code
          like this would require complex JavaScript programming involving the AJAX interface.</p>
        <p>As for the back-end development of our project, we were only able to implement the interface for dragging and
          dropping elements on the webpage. One major feature that would greatly benefit the final product is the
          implementation of a back-end database to store and retrieve data about activities and study materials. Since
          our team does not have any concrete experience with database programming and management, we did not attempt to
          pursue this feature during the limited time allotted for the project. The idea for a future extension to our
          project would be to first convert our website code into a web application using Java, and then implement the
          back-end database using SQL. By using Java as the foundation for our website, we would be able to use the Java
          Database Connectivity interface to integrate the SQL code into our web application.</p>
        <p>Finally, once all of these features are implemented, we will need to deploy our web application as a finished
          product. Since we intend to use Java as the foundation for our website, we can use a Java-based platform such
          as WebLogic Server from Oracle to deploy our product to the web.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="subsection" id="roles">
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Roles</h2>
        <p>The roles for each team member during the approximate 4 weeks of project work were planned to be as follows:
          Khoi as the Lead developer, Khang as the User interface designer and developer, and Khoa as the Web developer
          and Tester.</p>
        <p>As the person with the most web development experience, Khoi would take on the role as Lead developer for the
          project to manage and assign appropriate responsibilities for the other team members. Specifically, Khoi
          needed to take the initiative to set deadlines and project goals with specific tasks for each team member. As
          for his own programming tasks, Khoi would be responsible for coding the majority of the interactive features
          on the project demo webpage.</p>
        <p>Khang initially took the role of a User Interface (UI) designer due to his creativity and understanding of
          engaging user interface from playing video games. He designed the interface for the project webpages,
          including for the interactive activity in the demo webpage. Afterwards, Khang also would take over the role of
          a UI developer and implemented his designs for the project website and the report webpage.</p>
        <p>Khoa, on the other hand, volunteered to develop the front-end for the project website, as he wanted to
          improve his skills in web development, specifically in HTML programming. The web pages that he worked on
          include the demo page and the report page. In addition to his web development tasks, Khoa would also take the
          role of a tester for the interactive activities in the demo webpage. His responsibilities would then include
          ensuring the demo works correctly by identifying bugs and designing test cases.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="subsection" id="scopes-limits">
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Scopes and Limits</h2>
        <p>While we want to try our best to show other people what our complete website looks like, but in the meantime,
          our group can illustrate to the user the drag and drop style that we have talked about by a doing a simple one
          in our demo, and we even available to check your answer to show you if you are correct or not, and since our
          main goal is focus on topics like computer science and IT, we won’t be including other subjects into our
          website.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="subsection" id="tools-technologies">
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>To build this website we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, each with different purposes.
          HTML defines the structure of draggable elements, CSS can style the elements and provides the layout.
          JavaScript
          is for implementing drag-and-drop functionality by handling events. Khoi had a bit of prior experience but
          most
          of his experience came from this project.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="subsection" id="testing">
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Testing</h2>
        <p>The website's drag-and-drop function is tested by dragging chunks of code around to see if it works. All the
          functions of the website have been working smoothly so far. We will know when we have succeeded: when you get
          the wrong answer, the frame goes red and the score is lost and vice versa, when you get the right answer, the
          frame goes green, and the score is counted towards the total score. If we were to test users, we would need at
          least 3-5 people to test out the website, and to get them to test out the page we would need to send testers
          with some Visual Studio code experience the coding for the website.</p>

        <p>There were two difficulties we ran into. First was coding in Javascript due to how hard it was. Second was
          integrating Javascript codes into html.
          These two difficulties, if left unnoticed, can lead to the risk of the coding of the website messing up.</p>

        <p>We use Messenger to communicate with each other while discussing things related to assignments due to how
          fast, convenient and versatile it is; therefore, no meetings were required. So far, everyone has been
          cooperative and fast in responding although there were a few late responses. Khoi oversees making the website
          to showcase in our presentation while Khang works on coding the CSS styling for the report website. Meanwhile,
          Khoa works on the report page in HTML and writes his part in the report. All in all, this project has been
          smooth, and the work was suitably split. </p>

          CSS and JavaScript. By applying the basics of User Interface (UI) and User Experience design, the front-end
          web developer will also be responsible for designing the UI for the website. Having strong innovative and
          critical thinking to design clean, engaging UI is a valuable asset to have. Finally, they will collaborate
          closely with the back-end developer and educational consultant to implement the UI and functionalities for

        <p>The back-end developer will mainly be responsible for implementing and maintaining the back-end database for
          the product’s web application. With more funding and time to complete the project, implementing a database to
          more easily store and retrieve data about activities and study materials would be greatly beneficial for the
          final product. Therefore, this position will require a good understanding of database design to optimize the
          data storage and retrieval process for the website. The back-end developer will also need proficiency in
          JavaScript and an object-oriented programming language, such as Java or C#, to integrate the database
          functionalities with the UI. For this goal, they will collaborate closely with the front-end developer.
          Lastly, they will also need to collaborate with the educational consultant to design the database
          specifications to fit the project’s needs.</p>

        <p>This position is crucial to the development of the product. The quality assurance website tester will be
          responsible for performing testing to ensure the correct functioning of the product’s web application. To this
          end, they will work with the front-end and back-end developers, as well as the educational consultant, to gain
          a deep understanding of the product’s specifications and needs and to identify and resolve any issues that may
          come up during the development cycle. The tester will apply their knowledge on software testing and web
          development to create detailed test cases and produce testing artifacts, such as test plans and test reports.
          Knowledge of automated testing to implement reliable, accurate and repeatable testing will be a potential
          benefit if the scale of the project increases, and more funding and time are provided. Otherwise, excellent

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Khoa's Reflection</h2>
        <p>The website building has gone well. The goal of building a drag-and-drop website has been noticeably clear,
          which is to educate people about IT. The website itself is easy to use. I do not think there is anything to
          improve in my opinion.
          There are at least two surprising things about this project. One is that everyone has been very cooperative,
          much more cooperative compared to projects from my other courses.
          Two is how much of a great leader Khoi can be, as he split the project into an appropriate number of tasks for
          each of us to work on.
          Moreover, he gives me a valid opinion on how to work on an HTML report.
          I have learned something remarkably interesting about groups.
          They all have various other projects with unique approach methods which to me is fascinating. </p>

        <p>Our group planning was really smooth despite lack of communication at first, because of my lack of initiating
          the plan and time management went into this group. Thankfully, Khoi joined a bit later and helped us go
          through this project and we are able to finish this in the due time. I have learnt some small but helpful
          skills during this teamwork for the project which is how tasks can be separated for everyone in the group at
          their own pace.</p>

        <p>Overall, I believe that our group did a good job at producing the report and a deliverable for the project.
          Each team member contributed significantly to both the report and the deliverable, and everyone was receptive
          to feedback. Communication was surprisingly smooth, despite some slow responses at time, which can be easily
          improved for future projects with clearer plans and expectations. One useful skill I learned about groupwork
          through this assignment is how to take initiative and set goals with deadlines throughout the project.</p>
